# EDA Project: Analyzing Netflix and Disney Content

- This project involves conducting a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis** on two **Data Sets** stored in an AWS S3 Bucket.
- The analysis is performed using **Python** and **SQL**.
  
## üìù Description
- This project involves conducting a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on two datasets containing information about **Netflix** and **Disney+** content, with the data stored in an **AWS S3 Bucket**. The analysis is performed using **Python** and **SQL**.

## üéØ‚ÄäObjective:
- The objective of this project is to uncover patterns and insights within the content provided by **Netflix** and **Disney+**, and to compare the two platforms based on various factors such as genres, release years, and content types.

## üíª‚ÄäTools & Technologies:
- **AWS S3 Bucket** for data storage
- **Boto3** for interacting with the S3 Bucket using Python
- **Python** for data processing and analysis
- **SQL** for querying and filtering data
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## ‚è≥ Dataset
- The datasets used in this project are in a **AWS S3 Bucket** but can be accessed through the following links:
